Metapopulation dynamics: @hanski1998 

- Species pool: species in community (gamma diversity) but not detected by alpha diversity

- Distribution simulation:
	- Occupancy: rate of the species detected by sampling

## Metapopulation

- Patch: where species can live (with resource available)
	- bigger patch will hold more population
	- individuals move among patches (local extinction, imigration, colonization)
	- moving around among patch: long distance, different habitats
		- cross habitats they can't occupy (e.g. lakes for terrestrial species) => less crossing
		- cross habitats similar to their patches (e.g. humid forests for reptiles)
- assumption: if habitats i.e patches are stable, there should be a mean number of occupied patches
- level of colonization (intermediate situation with the highest)
	- 0 occupancy: no source, no colonization
	- 1 occupancy: no empty patch available, no colonization
- individual modelling of whats happening within each patch

**Borders and patchiness** ~ size and shapes of the habitats
- ?boder effect
- certain parameters might be different due to its distance to the border (e.g. humidity)

**Patch quality**
- 'source': source of the immigrants
- 'sink': receiving immigrants
- 'classical': the intermediate patch, receiving and sending
- the origin (I-E = 0): completely balanced population

- patch snapshot
	- lines in log connectivity plot:
		- over upper line: min. 90% occupany
		- between upper and bottom line: 50%
		- under bottom line: less than 10%
