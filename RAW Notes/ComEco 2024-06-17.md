# 1 VL: Ecological Niche 

## 1.1 Dimensions

Three dimension, i.e. ways to explain why an organism choose to exist in a certain time space.

- Food
	- Size, Quantity, Quality (Nutrient Value, Digesting Cost)
- Time
- Space

**Habitat** can relate to many things, e.g. defence strategy, predator, etc.

### 1.1.1 Niche Spectrum

Some species has wider spectrum, e.g.:
- Camouflage in background to avoid predator, but individually they are different, so that the predator won't find them all after one success
- some species can hide themselves in wider range of background variation, some are specified in a certain type of habitat

Systematic relation does not guarantee a relation in ecology (i.e. using the similar ecological niche)

Niche can be restricted by competitor, i.e. real niche is what a specie actually uses.

**Niche Breadth**, meaning species can use broad range of habitats
- more easily to survive (relatively)
- narrow: specialist
- broad: generalist

### 1.1.2 Calculation of the niche

**Electivity index**:
- use resource availability and usage to calculate
- index ranges from -1 to 1:
	- -1: resource is available but is not used at all
	- 0: resource is used in the available proportion
	- 1: resource is total prefered
- Absolute number of the resource is critical, some may come up with high index but the absolute number is small, it may be a rare event

**Niche theory (Pianka 1973)**
- To calculate niche breadth

**Niche overlap (Pianka 1973)**

_Wilnemiller and Pianka 1990_:
- Four Randomization algorithm (RA), relaxed/retained zero/niche breadth


# 2 Raw Data Introduction

## 2.1 Reptiles in Menabe

### 2.1.1 Menabe
- Dry forest in western Madaska
- Seasonal Forest: raining season is the main activity for all animals

### 2.1.2 Reptile Community

Lizard, Snakes, etc.

### 2.1.3 Data Collection
#### 2.1.3.1 Dataset 1: Reptile

- Protected area is conserved area without anthropogenic usage of the forest.
- Data are collected inside and outside the zone, is in the data
- One observation equals one 1km line-transect, habitat data also available

Datasheets:
- Community data
- Charasteristics of the transect
- Where is exactly the reptile found

#### 2.1.3.2 Dataset 2: Tadpole

- Madagascar Rainforest
- Transects data
	- along streams, bc. the species are found in stream
	- 30m line-transect in stream
- Data of the habitat 1: stream characteristics
- Data of the habitat 2: forest around the stream
- Data of the individuals and species
- Data on the microhabitat
- ?Data of the tadpole morphology, it determines what they eat and where they eat => **Eco-morphological Data** (Using morphological data but interpretate as functional data)
	- i.e. the difference of the mouthpart

# 3 Practice Part

## 3.1 Niche Overlap with EcoSim

- **Rows**: Species
- **Column**: Resource

**Niche Overlap**
- Resource States: how are the resources available.
	- if _Equiprobable_, each resource is equally available.
	- Resources with different availability may change analysis result.
		- e.g. niche overlap on rare resource has higher biological significance than niche overlap on generally available resources
		- > User-defined: here comes the availability

### 3.1.1 Simulation

- Simulation uses input data and try to generate how the random data will be => bootstrap
- Simulate randomized situation: species has no reference and will choose diet randomly => null distribution (i.e. no preference)
- if observed is siginificantly different, species has preferences
- four rules, RA determine how the simulation is made.
	- RA1 is too relaxed, may attribute to resource that specie cannot use
	- RA4 is too restricted, it may not able to attribute resource that our observation did not cover
	- RA2 and RA3 is more intermediate and has better flexibility

### 3.1.2 Result

**Pairwise**: pairwise niche overlap
- in our data: from 0.89 to 0.99, very similar among the stage

**P value significance**
- Index
	- We expected the diet changes, meaning the index is expected to be bigger
	- if observed always smaller than simulated (i.e. expected), variance don't change, niche has larger overlap
