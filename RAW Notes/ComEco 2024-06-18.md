# 1 Data in Ecology

- Sample unit (Observation) => 
- Data
	- qualitative
	- quantitative
		- continuous/discret
		- distribution (normal distributed?)
			- [ ] Homogeneity of variance? (residual distribution) #markTodo more explicit, what is residual distribution

- Usually data in ecology is not normal distributed
	- [ ] **Transformation** needed to make them normal #markTodo What transformation?

-  [ ] **Residual**: difference between actual value and predicted value (linear regression) #markTodo what does it have to do with homogeneity?

# 2 Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

An explanation from [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spss-statistics/beta?topic=features-discriminant-analysis):

Discriminant analysis builds a predictive model for group membership. The model is composed of a discriminant function (or, for more than two groups, a set of discriminant functions) based on linear combinations of the predictor variables that provide the best discrimination between the groups. The functions are generated from a sample of cases for which group membership is known; the functions can then be applied to new cases that have measurements for the predictor variables but have unknown group membership.

- **Central Point**
	- A point that has least distance sum to all points belonging to the same group
	- A cluster indicator? (ideal situation that cluster differ?)
	- Used to differentiate two groups (how? #markTodo)
