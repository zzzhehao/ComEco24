- Niche overlap might be temporarily
- Niche overlap might be only low-dimentionally

## Patterns of dietary niche breadth and overlap are maintained for two closely related carnivores across broad geographic scales. 

- **Lynx**
	- special predator: snowshoe hare
	- in canada
	- snowshow hare also in canada (similar geo distribution)

- Bobcat
	- red squirrel

- geographical overlap on the Canada US border

- Isotope ratio => food chain source (plant? C4 C3 differ in C/N ratio)
	- "Niche overlap in finer scale" ~ pray on different animals but still in the same food web system

- dietary niche overlap vs geographical niche overlap

# Ecological Niche Analysis w/ quantitative data

- Niche overlap in simulation: overlap of two distribution curve under area ~ #markTodo any relation with type 1 / 2 error? power analysis?
