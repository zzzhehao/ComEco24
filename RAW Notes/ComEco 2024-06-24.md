# Richness and diversity in communities
## Accumulation curve (collector?)

### Process
1. a series of draws from community
2. plot the draw: x=sampling effort (num. of draw), y=number of the species
	- community with more member: take longer time (more sampling) to rich the maximum (i.e. saturation?)
3. Draw multiple times (>1k) and calculate the mean of each x value
	- is thsi a part of test (e.g. PERMANOVA?)
	- Estimating species richness: robuster against sample size and data scales
1. Smooth curve with better visualization of curve saturation

- Problem on the field: draw is not absolutely random (distribution is not equal)
	- methods used for sampling
	- generally: bias in sampling, species availability in sampling, 
	- detectability (likelihood of detecting a specie given they are present) ~ sampling error

### Species richness: number of species
- #markTodo Cronogram (Chronogram)? Seasonality
- sampling methods are adjusted depending microhabitats targeted

### Species diversity 
- number of species (species richness?)
- abundance (standardized sample effor to allow comparison in abundance)
- community with more species diversity (and less abundance, i.e. dominance, i.e. species are evenly present in the community) will have greater or more ecological services (more ecological roles are played)
#### Index
- Simpson Index
- Shannon Index
	- log compress data scale
	- make index less sensitive to abundance difference (e.g. large diff between rare and common species)
	- **PIE**: modified shannon index = Probability of Interspecific Encounter ("draw of two species")
		- linearized, index between 0 and 1

## eDNA

- sampling approach
- DNA from habitats, i.e. DNA composition from community in the habitats
- DNA library required for precise identification
- ?how to differentiate between intraspecific and interspecific sequence diff
- DNA extraction play bigger role (e.g. in water: clumped vs. dispersed DNA samples)
	- => extra challenge for quantification => more replicates (are they biol. or techn?)
- reflects the environmental variation (temporal, seasonal)
- sampling: may contain many samples from species actually far away from the sampling site (but probably has no or only minimal biological meaning in the sampling environmental)
	- e.g. river sampling, contamination from upstream

## Functional diversity

- provides more information regarding to ecological roles than phylogenetic or species diversity
- **Keystone species**: species causing greatest impact in an ecological community
